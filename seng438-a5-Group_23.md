# Introduction

In this lab assignment, students were introduced to the fundamental concepts of reliability assessment and failure data analysis in software testing. The goal was to understand the importance of tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart with the help of Excel and to explore the reliability growth testing that helps identify the changes in the product over time. Additionally, the lab introduced the concept of failure data analysis and its significance in preventing future failures. The lab also focused on the use of two new software systems, C-SFRAT and RDC-11, for software failure data analysis and provided a comparison of their results. Through these activities, students gained a better understanding of the role of reliability testing in software development.
