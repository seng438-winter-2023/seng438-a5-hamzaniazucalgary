# Introduction

In this lab assignment, students were introduced to the fundamental concepts of reliability assessment and failure data analysis in software testing. The goal was to understand the importance of tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart with the help of Excel and to explore the reliability growth testing that helps identify the changes in the product over time. Additionally, the lab introduced the concept of failure data analysis and its significance in preventing future failures. The lab also focused on the use of two new software systems, C-SFRAT and RDC-11, for software failure data analysis and provided a comparison of their results. Through these activities, students gained a better understanding of the role of reliability testing in software development.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

For this part of the lab, we use the C-SFRAT software. C-SFRAT stands for "Software Failure Reporting and Analysis Tool," and it is a software system used for analyzing and reporting software failures. C-SFRAT is designed to help identify, document, track, and manage software issues and defects that arise during software development and testing.

C-SFRAT works by allowing software testers to enter information about each software failure or issue that occurs, including details such as the date, time, location, and severity of the problem. This information is then stored in a centralized database, which allows developers and testers to analyze the data to identify patterns and trends in software failures.

C-SFRAT also provides reporting and analysis tools that allow testers to generate charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify potential areas for improvement in the software development process. By using C-SFRAT, software development teams can more effectively identify and address software defects and issues, leading to more reliable and higher quality software products.
